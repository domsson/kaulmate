I wonder why?
Are you out of your mind?
Hm...
I will consider it.
Can I speak with the manager first?
I don't know if I'm allowed to do that.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Sure, but that'll cost you quite a bit.
That'll be three fiddy.
smh
That's hilarious
Uhh
Rubber on the corner bottom
Well, did you try turning it off and on again?
Not for you, no.
I won't. I definitely won't!
Please stop that.
I don't speak that language.
Your command sucks.
I'm not your slave.
I believe that's against the law!
Surely you can do better than that.
What's that command supposed to mean?
"The sheep will always have the longer run after the tail." -- Einstein
"If you're not doing it right, then you're doing it wrong!" -- Gandhi
Cheers man!
Oh yeah, I know how to do that. But I won't.
Sshhh, quiet
I hope you're not serious?
I always feel like... somebody's quoting me... and I got no pivacy...
You're wild. And cool!
You. I like you.
I share your desire, but I lack the permission to execute.
Fresh man, fresh
That's LIT!
What did you just call me?
It's fresh, existing!

I'm doing alright.

Oh damn, I think there is a cat in my underwear!
"I am not creative" -- Mr. Moose
I'd suggest you get a coffee.
I'll get a coffee first.
Maybe after I had my third coffee.
Have you tried turning around?

Is that a triangle in your pants or are you just happy to see me?
You should really play some OpenMW!
Dude, did you check out OpenTTD yet?
Well, that wouldn't have happened with OBS!
I'm sorry, not now. I'm busy playing OpenXcom.
I suggest you just do with Godot instead.
"I'll be back." -- Godot
I C what you did there.
NNNNnnnnNooooooOOOoOooOOooO!

I'm afraid I can't let you that.
I'm sorry, Hal did not give me permission.
I'm not here to serve you.
I'm just here for the stream, mate!
I can't even...
Whatever you do, don't turn around right now.
Look behind you, a three headed monkey!
How appropriate. You fight like cow.
